# P2P File Sharing System

This project implements a simple **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) file sharing system** using Java.  
The system consists of three main components: **Tracker**, **Seeder**, and **Leecher**.

 The **Tracker** manages peer information.
 The **Seeder** shares files.
 The **Leecher** downloads files from multiple seeders.


## Components

### 1. Tracker
The Tracker is responsible for managing peer information in the P2P network.  
It listens for incoming UDP messages from seeders and leechers, handles registration, queries, and updates, and periodically cleans up stale peers.

### 2. Seeder
The Seeder is responsible for sharing a file with leechers.  
It splits the file into chunks, registers with the Tracker, and serves chunks to clients upon request.  
It also sends periodic heartbeats to the Tracker to maintain its availability status.

### 3. Leecher
The Leecher is responsible for downloading a file from multiple seeders.  
It communicates with the Tracker to obtain a list of seeders, downloads the file in chunks, and assembles the file.  
It also provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to display the download progress.
